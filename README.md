# TributeMJ

This project has been motivated by the freeCodeCamp as the first challenge.

The challenge is about to create a tribute page to anyone you want.

You have to respecte users  stories to get the test passed.

So I ve tried to respect what i ve seen during the wev courses and make a responsive tribute page.
